# eso-dungeon-timer
This is an addon for The Elder Scrolls Online that tracks the elapsed time in normal and veteran dungeons. In most cases, the dungeon timer will begin when the player enters combat. The timer will automatically stop when the activity is completed. The timer is reset upon entering each new dungeon.
